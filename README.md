# Battery-Health-Prediction-Project
This project provides a complete workflow for predicting **battery health**—including **State of Charge (SoC)** and **State of Health (SoH)**—using machine learning models trained in a Jupyter notebook and deployed through a **Streamlit dashboard**.

✨ Features

📂 Upload your own battery dataset (CSV format).

📊 Automatic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): summary stats, missing values, correlations.

🤖 Pre-trained models for:

Random Forest (SoC & SoH)

LSTM (SoC & SoH)

🧾 User-friendly interface to input Current, Voltage, Temperature, and Time difference.

⚡ Instant predictions with multiple models for comparison.
